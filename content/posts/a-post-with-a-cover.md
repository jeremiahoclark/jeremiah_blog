## The Prince and the Dream

A Young Prince walked down the grand garden of his father’s courtyard, thinking of what to do. He discovered the neighboring Princess had another suitor - one with more money and notoriety than he. How, he thought, could he win her heart?

Suddenly, he felt a tap on his shoulder. It was his teacher! “Excuse me for startling you. I called out, but you did not hear me. What is so heavily weighing on your mind?”

“The Princess has another suitor. When she speaks of him she does so with softness. Further, the other suitor has more notoriety and coin than me. I’m perplexed...” The Prince responded. 

“Of how to win when odds seem against you?” the Teacher finished.

“Yes. Perhaps I should gain notoriety. Duel someone - maybe even the other suitor?!” The Prince explored. 

“Yet, if you killed this man will the Princess love you more? Actors playing monsters may find themselves unable to remove their costumes.” 

“What if,” the Prince continued, “I gained fame? Poured myself into my work and became beloved by the people?”

“This could work. But, when you work to fulfill the desires of others when will those desires be satisfied?”

“What do you mean?” the Young Prince asked 

“Fame is tricky. It inspires conceit. It attracts wolves with hidden fangs to your camp, and their bellies are empty. 

“Okay. Should she just accept me for me?” He said out loud. 

“The Teacher’s poise broke from laughter. “A marathoner does not claim to be fast and rejects the race. If you are in competition you must compete! You must act even until the final seconds before losing.”

Frustrated and humiliated, the Young Prince cried “so how do I win when I am losing the race?!” 

The teacher sensing the end of his lesson responded “Change what it means to win. If your objective is to win through status - attract her with fame and money. If your objective is to win through a greater power, then invite her to realize your dreams together.” The teacher sipped from his tea and continued. “To challenge yourself - for the sake of yourself - to best yourself physically, mentally, emotionally everyday is as practice to a runner; to fulfill the dreams that you hold next to your heart is a jewel rarer than diamonds.” The teacher chuckles, “this is the most attractive force in the universe. And, it will grip the heart of your princess too.”
